Great — here's a **robust and modular project plan** for your soccer broadcast-to-2D tactical map system. This structure is designed to allow **modular development**, **testability**, and **iterative refinement**. I’ll also flag future extension areas and provide the exact responsibility of each file.

# 📄 `main.py`

### 🔧 Entry point for the pipeline.

* Loads config, video, and orchestrates modules.
* Controls pipeline stage execution (e.g., detection, tracking, projection, visualization).
* Handles CLI arguments for video path, output mode, etc.

---

# 📄 `config.yaml`

### 🛠️ Central configuration file.

Includes:

* Model paths (YOLO weights, classifier)
* Tracker parameters (e.g., IOU threshold, max age)
* Homography corner coordinates
* Video input/output settings
* Debug mode toggles

---

## 📁 `utils/`

### General-purpose helper modules.

#### `video_io.py`

* Frame extraction, downsampling
* Frame iterator, cropping helpers

#### `drawing.py`

* Draw bounding boxes, labels, trails
* Output annotated frames

#### `homography_utils.py`

* Estimate and apply homography
* Point mapping to 2D pitch
* Store/load homography matrices

#### `logging_utils.py`

* Time-stamped logging
* Optional TensorBoard integration

#### `geometry.py`

* Helper math: point-in-polygon, intersection, distance

---

## 📁 `models/`

### Encapsulated model logic for detection and tracking.

#### `player_detector.py`

* Loads YOLOv8
* Runs inference per frame
* Filters results (confidence threshold, class filtering)

#### `ball_detector.py`

* Loads separate ball detection model or uses YOLO class
* Includes post-processing to handle false positives

#### `tracker.py`

* Wraps DeepSORT or ByteTrack
* Assigns track IDs
* Maintains state of each entity

#### `team_classifier.py`

* Classifies players into teams based on color/appearance
* Could be rule-based (HSV range) or ML-based (CNN classifier)

---

## 📁 `projection/`

### Camera calibration and spatial transformation logic.

#### `camera_calibration.py`

* Manages static or dynamic pitch calibration
* Computes homography matrix from 4 field points
* Could be extended to support auto-calibration

#### `pitch_mapper.py`

* Projects (x, y) player coordinates into 2D pitch layout
* Converts bounding boxes to center points
* Applies homography transformation

---

## 📁 `visualization/`

### Tactical view and playback renderer.

#### `render_2d_map.py`

* Draws real-time 2D pitch view using player & ball positions
* Optionally creates an animated video of the match
* Generates static screenshots or live playback

#### `pitch_layout.py`

* Defines line art of pitch (bounding box, center circle, boxes)
* Can use Matplotlib, Pygame, or custom canvas rendering

---

## 📁 `data/`

### Input/output assets.

#### `pitch_templates/`

* Coordinates for standard field dimensions (UEFA, FIFA, etc.)

#### `example_games/`

* Test videos or frames for dev/testing

#### `annotations/`

* Homography keypoints
* Manual validation results
* Player/team ID ground truth (if applicable)

---

## 📁 `tests/`

### Unit testing framework.

#### `test_modules.py`

* Basic PyTest or unittest cases to check:

  * Model loading
  * Homography accuracy
  * Coordinate projection
  * Team classifier sanity

---

# 🧠 Future Extensions

* `models/pose_estimator.py`: Estimate player body direction using keypoints.
* `models/action_recognizer.py`: Classify activities (pass, shot, tackle).
* `networking/stream_input.py`: Live stream support.
* `webui/`: Optional React+Flask frontend to control the system remotely.

# ✅ Next Steps

1. I can help scaffold this entire repo with blank files and function headers.
2. Then we implement modules step-by-step starting with `player_detector.py`.
3. We’ll maintain a shared TODO checklist for component completion.

Would you like me to generate the scaffolded file structure and placeholder code to get started?
